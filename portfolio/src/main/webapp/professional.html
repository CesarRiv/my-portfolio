            <h2>First Internship</h2>

        <div id="content">
        
         <p>I got introduced to the world of computer science during my first internship which was with Booz Allen Hamilton. I worked in a team with other interns 
            to create a web application(HTML & CSS) that would assist the user experience of people with mobility disabilities to better maneuver through office facilities.
            I captured 360 views with a Samsung camera and in coordination with team ArcGIS file creations to establish a stream line
            connection to the web application. The highlight of this summer was having the pleasure of meeting the CEO of the company 
            who is Horacio Rozanski.

        <h2>Second Internship</h2>
        <div id="content">
        <p>For my 2nd internship I returned to Booz Allen Hamilton. The team's goal was to develop a new epinephrine 
            auto injector that would compete with epipen. My main task for the summer was to distribute task to five memebers, including myself, 
            through skill alignment and close collaboration efforts that involve remote client engagement. I also constructed a 
            comprehensive buisness plan that included government project funding insight, executive summary, future process flows for 
            implementation and market analysis for company executives and key leadership stakeholders.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <div id="content">
            <h3>Product Search/TAMUHack</h3>
            <p>I was able to participate in the 2020 Texas A&M hackaton, where we had a 24 hour window to attempt a companies challenge which they set up.
                I decided to tackle Google's challange and created an applicationon which uses Vision (Google API) that detects items on a photo & then displayed 
                the locations where the item can be bought.
            </p>

            <h3>Gym App</h3>
            <p>For a class that focused on app development, as my final I constructed an IOS app using XCode designed to help users find new workouts for a specific 
                body part of the users choice. The user also had the ability to view a video showing how the workout could be done.
